## GuideLines
- I followed SOLID Principle
- Instead of adding comments for each function and its purpose, I tried to make the function name more meaningful and indicate the purpose of the function
- I tried to make code clean and make each some of the functions doesn't exceed 10 lines, and not adding more than 3 or 4 parameters which is one of the rules to make the code clean without any smells

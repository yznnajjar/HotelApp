## GuideLines
- I tried to follow SOLID Principle
- Instead of adding comments for each function about the purpose of this function tried to make the function name more meaningful and indicate the job for each function
- I tried to make code clean and make each some of the functions doesn't exceed 10 lines and note more than 3 or 4 parameters which is one of the rules to make the code clean
